# Manual preference adjustments

This file captures settings/changes that I make that I haven't yet figured out
how to conveniently keep synced or just haven't put in the work yet.

## Firefox

- https://cialu.net/how-to-turn-on-accelerated-compositing-layers-on-firefox/

### browserpass

https://github.com/browserpass/browserpass-native

The native component is installed by `packages.sh`, but the extension needs to be installed
manually.

### Tridactyl

https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl

~~The native messenger (firefox-tridactyl-native) should have gotten installed in `packages.sh`. With
that & the firefox extension installed, the checked-in `tridactylrc` config should be used.~~
