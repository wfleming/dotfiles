# Mail

## Packages

- neomutt (aur)
- isync (provides mbsync)
- msmtp (send email)
- elinks (text browser for reading html email)
- urlview (aur; open urls from emails externally)

## Setup

- Need to manually create ~/mail/(personal|codeclimate) for mbsync
- Make sure you have decrypted config for msmtprc & mbsync
  (Obviously only applicable to me, Will: if you're reading my dotfiles, refer to
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Msmtp &
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/isync for useful info on configuring
  those tools.)
- enable & activate the `systemctl --user` `imap-sync.timer` unit to get
  automatic periodic mail sync

## TODO (Things I need to figure out still)

- show when have unread mail in taffybar/systray somehow
- specific macro for GH emails to open links in one step?

# Notes

- `flag_chars` in `man muttrc` helps with what status flag chars mean
