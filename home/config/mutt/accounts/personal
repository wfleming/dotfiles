# A note of explanation on these macros: the general idea is to have easy
# shortcuts for sending either tagged or currently-selected message(s) to
# frequent archive destinations. When doing that I want to strip any "new
# message" flags (effectively mark them as read). Normally doing a command would
# advance the selection to the next message, that's what resolve controls.
# So what these are each doing is effectively:
# 1. turn off resolve
# 2. remove message flags (effectively mark as read)
# 3. turn resolve back on so selection will advance after final command
# 4. save the message to its destination
