# `manifest.yml` documents where to link/install all files.
#
# FORMAT
# The manifest is a hash map, with keys being glob patterns relative to cwd,
# and the values they point to being either target strings or a further
# hash map of options.
#
# OPTIONS
# `target` is a required option, and is either a directory
# (for globs that may match multiple files), or particular filepaths (for
# keys that will only match one file). Directories that need to be created,
# will be.
#
# `dotify` makes the install script make the target path for a file
# be the name of the source file, but with a `'.'` prepended.
